// Package calendar returns upcoming macro / crypto-cycle events for
// guanfu digest + watch use (Track F7).
//
// Philosophy: we DON'T fetch an external API. Event dates from FRED/BLS
// calendars have historically moved or been rate-limited. Instead:
//
//   - FOMC meetings: hardcoded per-year schedule (FOMC publishes ~1y out,
//     dates rarely change; refresh this table annually).
//   - CPI releases: rule-based (BLS publishes around the 10th-15th
//     of the following month). Approximate; user cross-checks date.
//   - BTC halving: deterministic from block height, known within ±week.
//   - Quarterly earnings peak: rule-based (mid-Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct).
//
// The output is a sorted list of events within a window; consumers
// (guanfu digest, SKILL) decide how to present.
