// Per-asset, per-horizon reliability wrappers — surfaced into forecast output
// so the consumer sees which horizons have been historically meaningful and
// which are essentially coin flips. The source table now lives in
// pkg/assetprofile so reading, forecast, skill, and backtest contracts share
// one policy source.
//
// The numbers below come from TestBacktestBundles (pkg/engine) on the
// post-refresh dataset (2026-05-11). They are the directional hit rate
// over the n_tests sliding-window backtests at that horizon. We treat
// dir_hit < 0.55 as "approaching random" — not a hard threshold but a
// reasonable fence for "don't draw conclusions from this".
//
// Updating: when TestBacktestBundles output changes materially, refresh
// the table here and the AsOf date. Don't auto-derive from a backtest
// run at panel-build time (would be slow and IO-heavy).
